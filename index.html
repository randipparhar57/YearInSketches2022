                        <h4>The inspiration behind this project</h4>
                        <p class = "introtext">Hello reader! I hope you are fine and dandy! Welcome to 2022 - A Year in Sketches. The idea for this project came to me in November of 2022 on Thanksgiving Day. My sister was working, and my parents had a dinner planned with some of their friends. To entertain myself, I started rummaging through my stuff and came across the postcard you see below (without the writing, that came afterwards.) I had bought this postcard in a shop on Bainbridge Island in Washington State back in February of 2022 with the intention of giving it to a friend of mine. I had forgotten to, and in all honesty, had forgotten about the postcard all together, until I came across it that night.</p>
                        <p class = "introtext">I started thinking about how the year was coming to an end in a matter of weeks. It was a tumultuous journey. 2022 will be remembered as one of the more defining years of my life. I experienced many new things and gained great memories. At the same time, those memories were being overcast by the rougher periods of my year. I wanted to find a way to pay homage to all of it though, because every single moment and memory has played an important part in shaping who I am as a person and the trajectory of my life.</p>
                        <p class = "introtext">And so, I picked up the postcard and a pencil and started drawing to capture the key moments of the last year. I opened YouTube and Spotify and started listening to the music that was most played during those time periods to travel back to specific moments and memories that are near and dear to me. And little by little, as I opened my mind and heart, I was reliving the defining moments of the past year.</p>
                        <p class = "introtext">This project would have been more complete if I had the journal that I kept during this time. Unfortunately, I lost it. That journal, in addition to my entries, also had mementos like concert tickets, receipts from my trip to Seattle, receipts from times that I hung out with other people, little cards, stuff like that. Now that I don't have those things, it almost seems as none of those things ever happened.</p>
			            <p class = "introtext">Initially, I was going to recreate those journal entries. However, the rewritten entries were not as authentic, raw, and honest as the originals. Hindsight takes over instead. And frankly, I’m not the best writer. Towards the end of the summer of 2022, I found the book “Daytripper” by Fàbio Moon and Gabriel Bà on a staircase of a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights. It was like kismet because the book ended up helping me through a period of transitions and changes. As I read the book, I came across so many excerpts that reminded me of moments that occurred throughout the year. And so, instead of journal entries, each memory will be accompanied by excerpts from “Daytripper” that remind me of those moments, whatever notes I have taken in my planner and phone during those times, and the music that was played during those time periods. Through creating these drawings, selecting excerpts from "Daytripper" and curating playlists of music I listened to most during those times, I was able to recreate those mementos - though they are not the original thing, the outcome is special in its own way. Something to keep in mind as you read the excerpts from “Daytripper” is not every entry is from my perspective, but of other people in my life. The nice thing about “Daytripper” is that it is a book that most everyone can relate to in their own unique way. I highly recommend reading it - the illustrations are evocative, and the writing is moving. It’s timeless in that it is relevant no matter what wave you are currently riding.</p>
                        <p class = "introtext">When I started this project, I never had any intention of sharing it with anyone. I started working on it to cope with some strong feelings I was experiencing at the time. The reason that I decided to share it upon its completion is because I recognize that I’m not the only one who feels like life is one, big sticky mess. Something that I’ve come to realize is that those sticky situations play an important part in our development and defining the trajectory of our life. In hindsight, those sticky situations are what differentiates between just existing versus living. I was hoping to have had this done by the end of December 2022 or beginning of January 2023, but I was busy with other aspects of life. I kind of feel silly for releasing this into the third month of 2023. However, finishing this project was necessary for me on a personal level. And, better late than never, right? I hope that my journey and this project helps bring joy or inspiration to those reading it.</p>
                        <p class = "introtext">Thank you to the people in my life who were there for me and saw the best in me, and for opening my eyes to a world that was under my nose this whole time. I wish you are all well, wherever you are.</p>
                        <p class = "introtext">With love,</p>

                        <p class = "daytripper">Bràs: No one really does. But, truth is, like it or not, everybody dies. Life is like a book, son. And every book has an end. No matter how much you like that book, you will get to the last page, and it will end. No book is complete without its end. And once you get, only when you read the last words, will you see how good the book is. It feels real.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">We live in a society populated by strangers. Each day, we feel more distance from each other, more alone, all while being surrounded by millions. Each day we watch as our city turns into a desert, one in which we are all lost – looking for that oasis we like to call… “love.” How do we find something – or someone – we can no longer see, but which is right there before us? And how do we hold on to what is most precious in life?</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">He made it two blocks before he realized he was no longer sad, he was happy and suddenly all he could think of was happy things. All he could think of was… her. She was the most beautiful creature on earth – her hair said so in that language only hair can speak.</p>

                        <p class = "daytripper">The next morning, everything seemed different. Even though everyday life resumed its course and people got back to their chores, now Bràs knew life awaited him out there. The house was no longer able to keep him locked inside. He was free as a bird.</p>

                        <p class = "daytripper">At the farm, the kids would discover everything in life could be fun. Even dangerous animals didn’t look like such a threat. Everything was safe. Life was harmless at the ranch.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">Bràs: I’m not going to wake up, am I?</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">Benedito: Guess not.</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">Bràs: Why? What happened?</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">Benedito: It doesn’t matter. The real question is, do you want to keep dreaming?</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">Bràs: Do I have a choice?</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">Benedito: You always have a choice.</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">Bràs: So what now?</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">Benedito: Well, just picture where you want to be and read the story until the end.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">It takes some time and a lot of looking around, but you eventually find that your home is a lot more than just the house you live in. Bràs had all the time in the world to figure that out. He discovered your country can be your home, or a city, or just that particular neighborhood. Sometimes your life changes, you change, and your home moves to a different place.</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">Bràs realized that home is not a physical place at all, but a group of elements like the people you live with - a feeling, a state of mind. He feels safer just knowing that even if he’s away, there is a home waiting for him to return. It’s where he can rest. Where he finds peace.</p>

                        <p class = "daytripper">I thought I had a great life, great job… but nothing in my life is extraordinary. Nothing in my life really matters. Life is too short, man. I’ve been wasting time. I can’t go back to that life. I’m never coming back. Do something with your life. Something that matters.</p>

                        <p class = "daytripper">Bràs: I have to get out of here. I need to wake up.</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">Jorge: Where do you think you’re going? You can’t just run away you know? It’s never that easy. You have a decision to make.</p>

Have you ever felt so alive – as if anything and everything is possible? She might already know. She might have even felt it, too. “This is it,” he thought. The moment where life truly begins.</p>

                        <p class = "daytripper">I hate you – you piece of shit! Those were her last words, and then she left. That’s how it felt anyway. He knows they kept arguing for hours after that, and several other words were uttered. Harsher words. The cruelest of words.</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">But those were the words that stuck. The ones that summed up everything. The ones that still echo off the walls of this empty apartment.</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">You think it’s for good, for life, forever… and for what? He only wished he knew what to do next.</p>

                        <p class = "daytripper">But good friends don’t go away that easily. They stay with you, stick in your memories, like pictures on the wall.</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">Bràs wonders if Jorge has become just a postcard to him, an image frozen in time that visits in his memories. The questions he wanted to ask for all these years seem pointless now. It’s been too long and a lot has changed. What if they’ve grown too far apart? What if they’ve become strangers? Would their friendship survive? More than ever, he feels lost, not certain what he’s going to find.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">There are a lot of things in this life that are difficult to understand, and even greater is the challenge of putting them into words. Friendship is certainly one of them.</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">He traveled halfway across the country, only to be brutally murdered at the hands of his best friend, who took his own life next. Bràs de Oliva Domingoes only did what he felt was right. He was 38 and died because he believed in friendship.</p>

                        <p class = "daytripper">In times like these, we seek comfort in the little pleasures. Things we’re glad man invented. It doesn’t matter where you’re from – or how you feel… there's always peace in a strong cup of coffee.</p>
